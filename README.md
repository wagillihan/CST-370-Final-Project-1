# CST-370-Final-Project-1
Project #1 (50 points). Consider that a sorted list of integers (e.g., 1, 1, 2, 2, 5,
5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11) provided to you.
The goal is to find the occurrences of an integer in the array using binary search.
For the above example, the occurrence of integer “5” should be 7.
a) (15 points) Design the algorithm and describe it in Pseudo code, including
necessary explanations so that the logic of your algorithm can be
understood.
b) (20 points) Implement your algorithm in C++ and test your implementation
with a tester/driver. The sorted list is stored in an array. The test array may
be hard coded in the tester program, but the integer number to be searched
for should be input from user (on console). Special cases should be properly
handled.
c) (10 points) Give the running time of your algorithm in big O notation
(briefly explain your reasoning). If the running time of your algorithm is in
O(log n) complexity, you will be given credit for this part (10 points).
d) (5 points) Make a video to give an overview of your algorithm and
implementation. Include the link to the video in your written document.
Submission instruction: Zip your source programs and written document in a
single file named as ‘Final_Project1_yourlastname’. For the program, please
include only the source files needed to compile and run successfully.
